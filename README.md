# TCP Handshake Client using Raw Sockets

This C++ program implements the **client side of the TCP three-way handshake** using **raw sockets**. It constructs and sends a custom SYN packet to a given server, receives a SYN-ACK, and responds with a final ACK to complete the connection. The client operates at the IP level, manually crafting headers and computing TCP checksums, providing low-level control over the handshake process.

## Features

- **Raw Socket Usage**: Bypasses the operating system’s TCP stack to send and receive raw IP packets containing TCP segments.
- **Custom TCP Handshake**:
  - Sends SYN packet with manually set sequence number.
  - Receives SYN-ACK from server and verifies expected sequence and acknowledgment numbers.
  - Sends final ACK to complete handshake.
- **Checksum Calculation**: Manually computes TCP checksum using a pseudo-header as per the TCP/IP specification.
- **Timeout Handling**: Implements a receive timeout to avoid hanging if the server doesn't respond.

## Prerequisites

This code requires:

- A **Linux system** with support for raw sockets.
- A C++ compiler (`g++` recommended).
- **Root privileges** to execute the program due to the use of raw sockets.

## How to Run the Code

### 1. Compile the Program

```bash
g++ client.cpp -o client
```

### 2. Start the Server

Make sure to first clone the course repository and start the provided server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/privacy-iitk/cs425-2025.git
cd cs425-2025/Homeworks/A3
g++ server.cpp -o server
sudo ./server
```

> **Note**: You must run the server using `sudo` since it also uses raw sockets.

### 3. Run the Client

In the same or a different terminal:

```bash
sudo ./client
```

Root access is necessary to create raw sockets.

## How It Works

1. The client creates a raw TCP socket and manually enables the `IP_HDRINCL` option so it can supply its own IP header.
2. It crafts a TCP SYN packet with a fixed sequence number (e.g., `200`) and sends it to the server.
3. It waits to receive a SYN-ACK response from the server. The expected sequence number from the server is fixed (e.g., `400`) as per the assignment constraints.
4. After receiving the correct SYN-ACK, it sends a final ACK packet with sequence number `600` and the appropriate acknowledgment number.
5. Upon successful transmission of the ACK, the handshake is considered complete.

## Output

Example output if the handshake completes successfully:

```
Sending SYN (seq=200)
Received SYN-ACK (seq=400 ack=201)
Sending ACK (seq=600)
Handshake complete
```

If the handshake fails (e.g., timeout or invalid packet):

```
SYN-ACK not received
```

## Notes

- Sequence numbers are hardcoded (`200`, `400`, `600`) to match what the server expects. These must not be changed for the assignment.
- The code sets a **5-second timeout** for receiving the SYN-ACK packet to avoid indefinite blocking.
- This client assumes both client and server are running on `127.0.0.1` (`localhost`).
- Wireshark or `tcpdump` can be used to verify the raw packet contents if needed.
